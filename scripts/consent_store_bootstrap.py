"""Install-level one-time choices: the single persistent consent authority.

One small JSON document (``mindie-consent/1``) per installation profile. Every
adapter sharing the profile reads the same saved choice; an isolated profile
has its own file and never inherits another profile's choice.

This module is the ONE shared implementation of that document: pure stdlib
and fully self-contained (no imports from the ``mindie_knowledge`` package),
so an adapter that cannot load the runtime before first setup may carry a
byte-identical bootstrap copy instead of a third hand-written fork.

Semantics (the precise contract is the lane's ``API.md``):

- ``read`` has zero side effects and never migrates; it distinguishes
  ``ok``/``missing``/``unreadable``/``corrupt`` strictly. A damaged document
  is a fault, never a fresh install and never a guessed opt-in or opt-out.
- ``record_choice``/``record_reporting`` apply explicit user-intent updates
  under a cross-process OS lock (never only a thread lock): re-read, merge
  the other field and every untouched key, then a unique temp file, fsync
  and an atomic replace. A corrupt or unreadable file is never silently
  cleared by a field update — the update fails and the bytes stay.
- ``migrate`` imports already validated legacy choices exactly once at an
  explicit install/upgrade/entry boundary. An existing valid authority
  always wins; evidence that is missing or conflicting yields a diagnosable
  no-write result, preserving the original data.

Platform note: on Windows a stdlib ``open`` shares read/write but denies
delete, so an atomic ``os.replace`` would fail whenever a reader holds the
file open at that instant. This module's read path therefore opens with
FILE_SHARE_DELETE on Windows (see ``_open_for_read``): a writer never fails
because the authority was read. Readers outside this module that hold the
file open WITHOUT delete sharing can still transiently block a writer on
Windows. Such a failed update preserves the existing document and reports
the error; it does not retry or reopen onboarding.
